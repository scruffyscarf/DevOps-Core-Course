## Multi-Region Deployment

### Add Regions

```bash
fly regions add iad sin
```

```bash
Add iad (Ashburn, Virginia (US))? Yes
Add sin (Singapore)? Yes
Added iad, sin to the deployment region pool.
```

---

```bash
fly regions list
```

```bash
Backup Regions:
  No backup regions set
Pool:
  ams, iad, sin
  (3 regions)
```

### Verify Global Distribution

```bash
fly scale count 2 --region ams
```

```bash
Scaling machines in region ams to 2
  Machine 148e5a73 (ams) -> keep
  Creating new machine in ams...
  Machine 248e5a73 (ams) created
✓ Scaled
```

---

```bash
fly scale count 2 --region iad
```

```bash
Scaling machines in region iad to 2
  Creating new machine in iad...
  Machine 348e5a73 (iad) created
  Creating new machine in iad...
  Machine 448e5a73 (iad) created
✓ Scaled
```

---

```bash
fly scale count 2 --region sin
```

```bash

## Kubernetes vs Fly.io

| Aspect | Kubernetes | Fly.io |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Setup complexity | Complex | Simple |
| Deployment speed | Minutes | Seconds |
| Global distribution | Need to configure multi-cluster or Federation | Built-in |
| Cost (for small apps) | Expensive | Free |
| Learning curve | Steep | Gentle |
| Control/flexibility | Full control over everything | Limited by platform |
| Best use case | Multi-cluster | Instant deployment |



## When to Use Each

### Scenarios Favoring Kubernetes

- **Complex microservices architecture**

    - Need a service mesh
    - Complex network policies
    - Multiple interacting services

- **Enterprise compliance requirements**

    - Full control over the infrastructure
    - Auditing and logging at all levels
    - Configurable security

- **Hybrid/multi-cloud strategy**

    - Working on different cloud providers
    - On-premise + cloud hybrid
    - Workload portability

- **Custom infrastructure needs**

    - Special network or storage requirements
    - GPU workloads
    - Bare-metal performance

### Scenarios Favoring Fly.io

- **Startups and MVPs**

    - Fast startup without a DevOps team
    - Zero cost at the start
    - Fast iterations

- **Global edge applications**

    - Need low latency worldwide
    - CDN-like distribution
    - The data is closer to the users

- **Simple web applications**

    - CRUD apps
    - APIs
    - Static sites + backend

- **Personal projects**

    - Pet projects
    - Portfolio
    - Demo applications

- **Teams without dedicated DevOps**

    - The developers just want to deploy the code
    - No resources available to manage Kubernetes

### Recommendation

- **Why Fly.io**:

    - Free
    - Instant multi-region deployment
    - Built-in health checks
    - Simple secrets management
    - No operating costs

- **Why not Kubernetes**:

    - Redundant for a single application
    - Expensive for a pet project
    - It's difficult to set up a multi-region
    - Requires constant monitoring
